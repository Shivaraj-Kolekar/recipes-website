    <h1 id="header">Parmesan Cheese Crisps</h1>
    <p class="recipe-description">Add these Parmesan cheese crisps to your charcuterie board, garnish a soup, or use in a salad instead of croutons. I like to use store-bought shredded Parmesan, as it gives the crisps a "lacy" appearance. You can also use freshly-shredded Parmesan, which will melt more easily, and the crisps will have a smoother, filled-in appearance. You can add a light sprinkle of your favorite seasoning to each crisp before baking, for added flavor.</p>

        <h3>Instructions: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a tablespoon, create 16 mounds of cheese, about 2 inches in diameter, spaced at least 1 inch apart, on the prepared baking sheet. Press down on the middle of each mound to make them evenly thick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is completely melted and edges are browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the oven to cool for 15 minutes. Remove from baking sheet and store at room temperature in an air-tight container for up to 5 days.
